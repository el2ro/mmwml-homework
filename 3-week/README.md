# Homework - Week 3

Build a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to predict fraudulent transactions by training
it on this kaggle dataset. Before you train the model, create at least 1 visualization of the data
using the seaborn library of your choice. This should be submitted as a ""jupyter notebook".

## Solution - by Sami

Downloaded data sets from the Kaggle
Figured out to join the dataset into one

Draw some grafs out of it, not really revealing anything to me

Needs a lot of cleanup before it was possible to feed into LinearRegression library

Returned as Jupyter notebook
